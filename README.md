2. **🏗️ App Architecture**

     I used Cubit for all business logic—authentication toggles, fetching specialists, booking, canceling, and rescheduling.
     I Used the provider to controll the state managment of selecting date and time in booking and rescheduling process.

    **Authentication Flow**

      Toggle between Sign In and Sign Up on the Auth screen.<br>
      Using Firebase to Sign In and Sign Up.<br>
      On success, navigate to Main Screen.<br>
      on logout, clear state and return to Auth.<br>
      Persist login state so returning users skip auth.<br>

   **Main Screen (Bottom Navigation)**

     - Log out Button -> log out form Firebase -> return to Authentication screen

     1. Find Specialists Body<br>
     Fetch from Firebase → cache to Hive → always read from Hive.<br>
     Show some information about the specialist: its name , category , its rate.<br>
     Search by name or filter by category from Hive.<br>
     Pull‑to‑refresh updates Firestore + Hive.<br>

    2. My Appointments<br>

       List your booked appointments -> Fetch from Firebase -> stroe in Hive -> always read from Hive.<br>
       Show some information about the specialist: its name , category , its rate.<br>
       Cancel Appointment with a tap.<br>
       Reschedule Appointment with a tap -> navigate to specialist screen.<br>
   
   3. Specialist Details Screen

      Profile header + About section.<br>
      Horizontal date picker show available dates → reveals available times in selected date.<br>
      “Confirm” button books or reschedules -> hides booked time slotes -> auto‑refreshes appointments and specialists.<br>

4. **Business Understanding**<br>

   The App Facilitates finding and booking professionals. Instead of searching on phone numbers or sending endless emails, users can simply tap to browse specialists like "therapists or trainers" view his 
   profile section and his rate, see exactly when they’re free, and book an appointment instantly.<br>

5. **Known Limitations**<br>
